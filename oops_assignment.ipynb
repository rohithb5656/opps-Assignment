        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (way of writing code) that is based on the concept of “objects”.\n",
        "\n",
        "These objects are real-world entities that have:\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes (data) — stored in variables called properties\n",
        "\n",
        "Behaviors (functions) — written as methods\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A class is the blueprint or template used to create objects in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines:\n",
        "\n",
        "The attributes (also called variables or properties)\n",
        "\n",
        "The methods (functions) that the object will have\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: An object is an instance of a class. It is the real-world entity that gets created using a class blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: a. Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps to reduce complexity and focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Encapsulation means binding data and methods into a single unit (a class) and restricting access to some components. It protects the internal data from being directly accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Dunder methods (also called magic methods) in Python are special methods that begin and end with double underscores (__), like __init__, __str__, and __len__.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are automatically called by Python in certain situations and allow us to define how objects of a class should behave with built-in functions or operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Inheritance is an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps in code reuse, avoids duplication, and creates a relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANs: Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In object-oriented programming, it allows methods or functions to behave differently based on the object or data they are working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows the same method name to perform different tasks depending on the object (class) that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit, usually a class. It helps to protect data from outside interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It gets called automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object (instance). It takes cls as its first parameter, which represents the class itself, and not the instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex: class Student:\n",
        "    school = \"ABC School\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def change_school(cls, name):\n",
        "        cls.school = name\n",
        "\n",
        "Student.change_school(\"XYZ School\")\n",
        "print(Student.school)  # Output: XYZ School\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A static method does not take self or cls as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but resides in the class’s namespace. It’s used when you want to logically group a function with a class, but the function doesn't need access to class or instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex: class MathHelper:\n",
        "\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def add(a, b):\n",
        "        return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "print(MathHelper.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method overloading in Python means creating a method that can perform different tasks based on the number or type of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "ex: class Calculator:\n",
        "    def add(self, a=0, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "calc = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calc.add(5))         # Output: 5\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 10))     # Output: 15\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 10, 15)) # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method overriding in Python means redefining a method in the child class that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "ex: class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "d = Dog()\n",
        "d.sound()  # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The @property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a \"getter\" for a class attribute.\n",
        "It allows you to access a method like an attribute — without using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "ex: class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self._name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        return self._name\n",
        "\n",
        "s = Student(\"Suraj\")\n",
        "print(s.name)  # Output: Suraj\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means the same function or method can behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be directly instantiated and is used to define a common interface for its subclasses. It often contains one or more abstract methods—methods that must be implemented in any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "Ans: The advantage of oops are:-\n",
        "a. Code is easy to manage\n",
        "b. We can reuse code using inheritance\n",
        "c. Helps keep data safe with encapsulation\n",
        "d. Makes code flexible using polymorphism\n",
        "e. Good for building large and complex programs\n",
        "f. Easy to update and fix bugs\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Class Variable :\n",
        "a. Shared by all objects of the class.\n",
        "b. Defined inside the class, but outside any methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variable:\n",
        "a. Unique to each object.\n",
        "b. Defined inside methods, usually in __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "Ans: Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit features from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "Ans:  __str__ method:\n",
        "a. Used to return a readable or user-friendly string of the object.\n",
        "b. Called when you use print() or str() on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " __repr__ method:\n",
        "a. Returns a developer-friendly string with more detail.\n",
        "b. Called when you use repr() or just type the object in the shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "Ans: The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class. It helps when a child class wants to reuse the functionality of its parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "Ans: __del__ is a special function in a Python class.\n",
        "It runs when the object is about to be deleted (removed from memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "Ans: @staticmethod: A method that does not know about the class or the object. It’s just a normal function inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod: A method that knows about the class and can change class variables or create new objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance+\n",
        "Ans: olymorphism means different classes can have methods with the same name.\n",
        "When you call that method on an object, Python runs the version of the method for that object's class — even if you’re working with a parent class reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "ex: class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
        "\n",
        "def make_sound(animal):\n",
        "    animal.sound()  # Calls the method for the actual object's class\n",
        "\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "make_sound(dog)  # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "make_sound(cat)  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "Ans: Method chaining means calling multiple methods one after another on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself (self), so you can keep calling another method right after.\n",
        "\n",
        "ex: class Car:\n",
        "    def start(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Car started\")\n",
        "        return self  # Return the object to allow chaining\n",
        "\n",
        "    def drive(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Car is driving\")\n",
        "        return self\n",
        "\n",
        "    def stop(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Car stopped\")\n",
        "        return self\n",
        "\n",

        "car.start().drive().stop()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans: __call__ is a special method you can add to a class.\n",
        "It lets you make an instance of the class behave like a function.\n",
        "To make objects that can be called like functions.\n",
